### Description
The unofficial Runkeeper API - Pretty much hacked, but better than nothing

### Requirements
PHP 5+, json_decode(), Runkeeper Account

### Details
More info coming soon. Currently hacking this apart making some usable methods. This API won't add records to your database, just a date-range query for information for you and your street team. You could very easily add this info to a database. Anyway, examples coming soon.
